\section{Introduction}

% security is important
Modern society and economy increasingly depend on digital systems.
As attacks against such systems can have devastating results, it is very important to secure such systems in a proper way.
Nowadays the Internet is a heavily used and very important communication medium.
An increasing number of devices are connected to the Internet, which is why it is important to transmit and store sensitive data securely.

% Developing secure systems is difficult
The correct development of secure software is difficult.
There have been numerous successful attacks abusing vulnerabilities of software systems in the past and it is to expect that people will try to abuse such flaws in the future as well.

% System development has to take security aspects into account.
The traditional approach for security assurance has been ``penetrate and patch'', where security is assured by attempting to break into a running system and exploiting well-known vulnerabilities.
Penetrate and patch happens too late in the development process and vulnerabilities will be available and possibly exploited  until they are recognized fixed.
This is why it is important to take security aspects into account in an early stage of the system development.
